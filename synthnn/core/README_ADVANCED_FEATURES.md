# Advanced Features in SynthNN

This document describes three advanced features that extend SynthNN's capabilities into new dimensions of complexity and intelligence.

## ðŸŒŠ 4D Resonance Fields

The 4D Resonance Fields module (`resonance_field.py`) extends resonant networks into spatial dimensions, enabling wave propagation, interference patterns, and emergent spatial dynamics. The "4D" represents 3D space + time.

### Key Concepts

- **Spatial Resonant Nodes**: Nodes that exist at specific 3D positions and radiate waves
- **Wave Propagation**: Waves travel through the field at finite speed following the wave equation
- **Boundary Conditions**: Control how waves behave at field edges (absorbing, reflecting, periodic, radiating)
- **Resonant Cavities**: Regions with different medium properties that can trap and amplify waves

### Usage Example

```python
from synthnn.core import ResonanceField4D, SpatialResonantNode, BoundaryCondition

# Create a 3D resonance field
field = ResonanceField4D(
    dimensions=(50, 50, 50),      # 50x50x50 grid
    resolution=1.0,               # 1 meter per grid point
    wave_speed=343.0,             # Speed of sound in air
    boundary_condition=BoundaryCondition.ABSORBING
)

# Add spatial nodes
node = SpatialResonantNode(
    "oscillator",
    position=np.array([25, 25, 25]),  # Center of field
    frequency=440.0,                   # A4 note
    amplitude=1.0,
    radiation_pattern="omnidirectional"
)
field.add_spatial_node(node)

# Create a resonant cavity
field.create_resonant_cavity(
    center=np.array([25, 25, 25]),
    dimensions=np.array([10, 10, 10]),
    impedance_ratio=10.0
)

# Simulate wave propagation
for _ in range(1000):
    field.step(0.001)  # 1ms time steps

# Extract 2D slices for visualization
xy_slice = field.extract_slice('z', 25)  # Horizontal slice at z=25
```

### Applications

- **Acoustic Modeling**: Simulate sound propagation in rooms and concert halls
- **Neural Field Theory**: Model spatially extended neural networks
- **Wave-based Computing**: Perform computations using wave interference
- **Holographic Storage**: Store patterns as interference patterns

## ðŸ§  Collective Intelligence Framework

The Collective Intelligence module (`collective_intelligence.py`) enables multiple resonant networks to work together as a collective, exhibiting swarm intelligence, distributed decision-making, and emergent behaviors.

### Key Concepts

- **Network Roles**: Each network has a specialized role with influence weights
- **Communication Modes**: Networks can communicate via phase coupling, frequency modulation, or direct signals
- **Consensus Methods**: Decisions made through synchronization, voting, emergence, or hierarchy
- **Distributed Memory**: Patterns stored across multiple networks for redundancy

### Usage Example

```python
from synthnn.core import (
    CollectiveIntelligence, CommunicationMode,
    ConsensusMethod, NetworkRole, ResonantNetwork
)

# Create collective
collective = CollectiveIntelligence(
    name="decision_maker",
    communication_mode=CommunicationMode.PHASE_COUPLING,
    consensus_method=ConsensusMethod.VOTING
)

# Add specialized networks
sensor_network = ResonantNetwork("sensors")
# ... configure sensor_network ...

role = NetworkRole(
    name="sensor",
    frequency_band=(1.0, 10.0),
    influence_weight=1.5,
    receptivity=0.8,
    specialization="sensing"
)
collective.add_network("sensor", sensor_network, role)

# Connect networks
collective.connect_networks("sensor", "processor", weight=2.0)

# Make collective decisions
options = ["action_a", "action_b", "action_c"]
decision = collective.make_collective_decision(options)

# Store and recall patterns
collective.store_pattern("important_pattern", pattern_data)
recalled = collective.recall_pattern("important_pattern")
```

### Applications

- **Distributed AI**: Create AI systems with specialized sub-networks
- **Consensus Algorithms**: Novel approaches to distributed consensus
- **Swarm Robotics**: Coordinate multiple agents through resonance
- **Brain Modeling**: Model interactions between brain regions

## ðŸ§¬ Evolutionary Resonance

The Evolutionary Resonance module (`evolutionary_resonance.py`) implements genetic algorithms for resonant networks, allowing them to evolve, adapt, and speciate based on fitness criteria.

### Key Concepts

- **Genomes**: Genetic representation of network topology and parameters
- **Species**: Groups of similar networks that can interbreed
- **Fitness Metrics**: Harmony, efficiency, information capacity, adaptability, creativity, memory
- **Mutations**: Changes to frequencies, connections, topology
- **Crossover**: Combining parent networks to create offspring

### Usage Example

```python
from synthnn.core import EvolutionaryResonance, FitnessMetric

# Create evolutionary system
evo = EvolutionaryResonance(
    population_size=50,
    fitness_metric=FitnessMetric.HARMONY,
    mutation_rate=0.1,
    crossover_rate=0.7,
    speciation_threshold=0.3
)

# Initialize random population
evo.initialize_population()

# Evolve for multiple generations
for generation in range(100):
    evo.evolve_generation()

    # Get best network
    best = evo.get_best_genome()
    print(f"Gen {generation}: Best fitness = {best.fitness:.3f}")

# Extract evolved network
best_network = best.to_network()

# Custom fitness function
def my_fitness(network):
    # Evaluate network for specific task
    return score

evo_custom = EvolutionaryResonance(
    fitness_metric=FitnessMetric.CUSTOM,
    custom_fitness=my_fitness
)
```

### Fitness Metrics

1. **HARMONY**: Optimizes for consonant frequency ratios and synchronization
2. **EFFICIENCY**: Minimizes energy loss while maintaining function
3. **INFORMATION**: Maximizes information processing capacity
4. **ADAPTABILITY**: Ability to recover from perturbations
5. **CREATIVITY**: Generates diverse, complex patterns
6. **MEMORY**: Pattern storage and recall capacity
7. **CUSTOM**: User-defined fitness function

### Applications

- **Network Optimization**: Automatically find optimal network configurations
- **Music Generation**: Evolve networks that produce harmonic music
- **Problem Solving**: Evolve networks to solve specific tasks
- **Artificial Life**: Study emergence and speciation in artificial systems

## ðŸ”— Combining the Features

These three features can be combined for even more powerful applications:

### Example: Evolving Collective Spatial Intelligence

```python
# Create evolutionary system with collective intelligence
evo = EvolutionaryResonance(
    population_size=30,
    fitness_metric=FitnessMetric.CUSTOM,
    use_collective=True  # Enable collective intelligence
)

# Custom fitness that evaluates collective behavior in space
def spatial_collective_fitness(network):
    # Add network to a collective in a spatial field
    collective = CollectiveIntelligence(use_spatial_field=True)
    collective.add_network("test", network, position=np.random.randn(3)*10)

    # Evaluate collective's ability to synchronize spatially
    for _ in range(100):
        collective.step(0.01)

    # Return spatial coherence as fitness
    return collective.spatial_field.get_field_statistics()['coherence']

evo.custom_fitness = spatial_collective_fitness

# Evolve networks that work well together in space
evo.initialize_population()
for gen in range(50):
    evo.evolve_generation()
```

### Example: Emotional Resonance in 4D Fields

```python
from synthnn.core import EmotionalResonanceEngine, EmotionCategory

# Create emotional engine
emotion_engine = EmotionalResonanceEngine()

# Create spatial field for emotions
field = ResonanceField4D(dimensions=(40, 40, 40))

# Map emotions to spatial regions
emotions = [EmotionCategory.JOY, EmotionCategory.SADNESS, EmotionCategory.CALM]
positions = [np.array([10, 20, 20]), np.array([30, 20, 20]), np.array([20, 20, 20])]

for emotion, pos in zip(emotions, positions):
    # Create emotional network
    network = emotion_engine.create_emotional_network(emotion, intensity=0.8)

    # Add to spatial field
    for node_id, node in network.nodes.items():
        spatial_node = SpatialResonantNode(
            f"{emotion.value}_{node_id}",
            position=pos + np.random.randn(3)*2,
            frequency=node.frequency,
            amplitude=node.amplitude
        )
        field.add_spatial_node(spatial_node)

# Emotions propagate and interact through space
for _ in range(1000):
    field.step(0.01)
```

## ðŸš€ Performance Considerations

### 4D Resonance Fields

- Computational complexity: O(nÂ³) for nÃ—nÃ—n grid
- Memory usage: ~8 bytes per grid point per field variable
- Use smaller grids or adaptive resolution for real-time applications

### Collective Intelligence

- Scales with number of networks and connections
- Communication overhead can be reduced with sparse topologies
- Consider using GPU acceleration for large collectives

### Evolutionary Resonance

- Population size vs. diversity trade-off
- Parallel evaluation of fitness can speed up evolution
- Save/load populations to continue evolution across sessions
